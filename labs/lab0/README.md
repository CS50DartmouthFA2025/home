# Lab 0 - Setup

This first assignment is simple but essential.
It's not graded, but is **required** for you to participate in the course.

## Part 1: Team Formation (5 minutes)

Visit [Canvas](https://canvas.dartmouth.edu/courses/71659) and click *Team Formation* link on the left side.
Answer its questions **by midnight EDT tonight** ([Instructions](https://services.dartmouth.edu/TDClient/1806/Portal/KB/ArticleDet?ID=128042)).
It should take you less than five minutes.

This form provides us with the information we need to:

- give you access to our class website (including Lab 0!)
- to form learning groups (project teams),
- to learn more about your background, and
- to help support you through the term.

I will be adding everyone to our class website on GitHub in the early afternoon following our first class.

<!-- @CHANGEME link -->

<!--
I want to meet you all! Please consider
[signing up](https://calendly.com/ccpalmer/chatz) on Calendly for a quick, 10-minute chat to introduce yourself and meet me ... I also hope to talk with many of you often in office hours throughout the term. The chat is optional.
-->

## Part 2: Slack (2 minutes)
Complete this step **before the next class meeting**.

Join our Slack Workspace via the link on the front page of our Canvas sites.

<!--
> [!NOTE]
> We have a single Slack workspace for the *two* sections of COSC 50 this term.
-->

You'll automatically be added to several COSC 50 slack channels within our workspace.
All official course communications will come through Slack and Canvas.

> [!NOTE]
> Do not send the teaching team email! All communications must be via Slack

## Part 3: Systems (20 minutes)
Complete this step **before the next class meeting**.

Read through the [Systems](https://github.com/CS50DartmouthFA25/home/blob/main/logistics/systems.md) page.
Most of you use MacOS or Windows -- not Linux -- but in this course we will program exclusively on Linux.
For consistency, we will all use a Linux server managed by our colleagues in the Thayer School of Engineering.
This machine is known as `plank.thayer.dartmouth.edu`.
Follow the instructions in this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/CS50DartmouthFA25/cs50-dev) to get yourself ready.
