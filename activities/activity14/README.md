# Can you break it?


Put your team's answers in a Markdown file and upload it to Canvas for Activity 14.

## or, _If it's worth doing, it's worth testing._

For this activity we will discuss testing plans. 

In the following scenarios, you and your team should discuss appropriate testing 
plans. The tests should be automatable, such as via a `Makefile` or test program
or shell script.

## What to test ?

Consider these aspects of the software being tested:

- what the software is expected to do
- what are the inputs (types, ranges, valid/invalid inputs, edge cases, etc.)
- what are the expected outputs (types, ranges, valid/invalid inputs, etc.); 
in particular, are there any outputs with unintended side-effects
- are the expected users novices, experienced users, or both
- are there needed tests to verify the code doesn't do what it shouldn't do
- are there any "fail safe" situations that need testing? (may not be automatable)

## Scenarios

1. Software to operate a bluetooth-enabled home door-lock operated by a phone.
2. A drone-based coffee delivery service.
3. An app to control access to personal health information stored on a phone.
4. Software to operate a robotic lawn mower.
5. Autograding software for COSC 50 lab assignments.
