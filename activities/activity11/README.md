# Activity: Squashing bugs with `gdb`!

You could use `printf's` to find the bugs, but it's a lot faster to use `gdb`!
Run `make` to build them all.

Put your team's answers in a Markdown file and upload it to Canvas for Activity 11.

1. `alpha.c`
    crashes with segfault. why?
2. `beta.c`
    just hangs ... why?
3. `gamma.c`
    crashes with segfault. why?
4. `delta.c`
    why does this always return `inf` (infinity) ?
5. `epsilon.c`
    when does `0xbeef` appear on the stack?  
6. `zeta.c`
    why doesn't this insertion sort work?
7. `eta.c`
    pushing onto the queue works, so why doesn't pop work?
8. `theta.c`
    password checker sometimes accepts the wrong password
9. `iota.c`
    golden ratio approximator doesn't even get close!
10. `omega` thought challenge 
    How would you detect a cycle in a linked list?
