# Activity - Memory games

## 1. Show 'em

Copy the `activity6-1.c` file from the examples folder into a new 
directory called `memorygames` into your `~/` on plink 
and then `cd` into that directory.

In place of the comments in the `showx` and `showy` functions, 
add code to print out the address of the `x` and `y` variables, 
respectively. 

Hint: use `%p` to print out pointer values.

Note: the compiler will warn you about unused variables. We will ignore it in this exercise. In real-world projects, unused variables are to be avoided since they reduce readability and may cause confusion or even bugs.

Do you notice anything unexpected about the resulting output? 
Can you explain it?

_note: (#2 based on exercises from a CS class at Villanova)_

## 2. swapping pointers

Copy the `activity6-2.c` file from the examples directory into  
the `memorygames` directory on plink.

The `swap_nums` function seems to work, but the `swap_pointers` 
functions does not. Can you fix it?

## 3. Buggy `stringcat`
Copy the `stringcat.c` file from the examples directory into `~/memorygames`.

The code is buggy and triggers a *stack smashing detected!* error and crashes.

Study the code to be able to put answers to the following questions in a markdown for upload to Canvas Activity 6. 

* Explain the pointer notation used in the parameters.
* Explain the pointer notation used in the conditional.
* Explain what the two loops accomplish
* Why is there an assignment after the loop?
* Where is the bug in `main()`?
* What might go wrong inside `stringcat`?

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>

void stringcat( char *sp, char *dp);

int main()
{
  // initialize the first few characters of the arrays
  char src[8]  = "CS50";
  char dest[8] = "abcdef";

  printf( "dest started as: \"%s\"\n", dest);

  stringcat(src, dest);
  printf("src  = '%s'\n", src);
  printf("dest = '%s'\n", dest);
  return 0;
}

/* stringcat - cat string from source sp onto destination dp */
void stringcat(char *sp, char *dp)
{
  while (*dp)
	  ++dp;

  while (*sp != '\0') {
    *dp++ = *sp++;
  }
  *dp = '\0';
}
```

## 4. Reverse the string arguments

Write a small C function `flip` that:

1. takes an pointer to char as its only argument
2. print the string pointed to, then print the same string backwards.
3. the function may have only one other variable, a pointer 
to char, and the only function it can call is `printf`.

Here's the `main` program to test your `flip` function:

```c
include <stdio.h>

void flip (char *);

int main()
{
    /* strings is an array of pointers to char */
    char *strings[] = {"this", "is", "a", "test"};
    int i;

    for (i=0; i<(sizeof(strings)/sizeof(char*)); ++i) {
        flip(strings[i]);
    }
    return 0;
}

void flip(char *p)
{
  char *q;

  /***********************/
  /* your code goes here */
  /***********************/

  return;
}

```
