We use the Scrum style of project management in CS50 - and you'll likely encounter Scrum or its variants in your next job as a developer.

[Here are the slides](https://github.com/CS50DartmouthFA25/home/blob/main/knowledge/units/media/scrum/scrum-slides.pdf) from class.

For a complete treatment of Scrum, read *_The Scrum Official Guide_* [here](https://github.com/CS50DartmouthFA25/home/blob/main/knowledge/units/media/scrum/Scrum-Guide-2020-US.pdf).

[!IMPORTANT]
The Official Scrum Guide uses the term "Scrum Master" to describe the person responsible for guiding the team through the scrum process. In this class, we prefer the term "Scrum Leader" or "Scrum Monster", and each team's Scrum Leader will be their Learning Fellow.
